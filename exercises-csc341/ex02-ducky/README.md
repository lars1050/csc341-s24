### Ducky Inheritance and Scope Exercise

Pull this exercise from Git.

1. Together as a group, draw one UML diagram of the various classes. Be sure to include all member variables and methods (except getters and setters, which are not typically included). Put your names at the top and submit at the end of class.

2. Fix the code, answering the questions on the worksheet as you go. When you are done, zip your code along with your responses and submit to Moodle.

	In Main.java, there are a series of Ducks that are instantiated, then each one is described, flies, and speaks. When you run it, you will see something is very wrong. Most are printing out incorrect information. Eventually (once you have fixed the code), you will see the output below.

> Note: there is one issue that will prevent it from running that you need to fix before you see results. And no changing member variables in Duck from private to protected.


	
3. Together as a group, create one drawing of objects that represent the instantiated ducks. Embed a parent class object inside the child class object. Show the member variables and methods. Put your names at the top and submit at the end of class.
